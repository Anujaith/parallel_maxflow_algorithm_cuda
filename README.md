# parallel_maxflow_algorithm_cuda
Algorithm used- I'm using Ford-fulkerson algorithm to find out the Max flow of the network.


Code structure- In src contains parallel implementation code.


testcases- there are two sample testcases to find maxflow of the network.



code execution -compile maxflow.cu file in Google colab or nvcc src/filename.cu.

# parallel_maxflow_algorithm_cuda
Algorithm used- I'm using Ford-fulkerson algorithm to find out the Max flow of the network.


Code structure- src contains parallel implementation.


dataset - contains graphs of varying size to find maxflow of.



code execution -compile maxflow.cu file in Google colab.
